Jeie (Java Easy Image Editor) is a copyleft project which
is aimed at making a small and simple image editing UI.

Whilst the project is easily extensible, you should make
sure that you understand our goal before adding anything.
Therefore, our goal is outlined within this document.

Copyleft
Jeie is built under the realization that because it
can be easily redistributed to hundreds of people
with the simple click of a button, unlike a finite
resource such as a chair or food, and because its
use does not limit others' uses of it, it does not
make sense to make it proprietary, and likewise,
Intellectual Property Rights do not make sense.
Therefore, in order to ensure that it, and all other
software that uses it, remains free, it has been
placed under a viral copyleft license, GPL.

Note: We do not condone violation of Intellectual
Property Rights or copyright law. Please work
within the law to see it changed.

Simplicity
We aim for a simple and non-bulky interface. Unlike
GIMP, which is extremely bulky with hundreds of menus,
we wish to keep this down to a few commonly used
buttons, more like MS Paint, so as to appeal to the
novice user. Multiple layers, fancy palettes, and
vector graphics are all beyond the scope of this
project, and if you feel so inclined, you are
absolutely welcome to create a branch. That said,
we also realize that there are many limitations to
paint which could easily be corrected while still
maintaining the philosophy of simplicity.
